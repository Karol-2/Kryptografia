i walked through the door with you the air was cold but somethin
 bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at you
r sisters house and youve still got it in your drawer even now  
oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze were singin in th
e car getting lost upstate autumn leaves fallin down like pieces
 into place and i can picture it after all these days  and i kno
w its long gone and that magics not here no more and i might be 
okay but im not fine at all oh oh oh   caus there we ar again on
 that little town street you almost ran the red cause you were l
ookin over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all t
oo well   photo album on the counter your cheeks were turnin red
 you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed and
 your mothers tellin stories bout you on the teeball team you ta
ught me bout your past thinkin your future was me and you were t
ossing me the car keys fuck the patriarchy keychain on the groun
d we were always skippin town and i was thinkin on the drive dow
n any time now hes gonna say its love you never called it what i
t was til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse and c
ome back swearin its the same after three months in the grave an
d then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you but al
l i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame  and i know it
s long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget a
bout you long enough to forget why i needed to  cause there we a
re again in the middle of the night were dancin round the kitche
n in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i rememb
er it all too well and there we are again when nobody had to kno
w you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath sacred p
rayer and wed swear to remember it all too well yeah  well maybe
 we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe
 this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up runnin scar
ed i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up aga
in just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name
 of bein honest im a crumpledup piece of paper lyin here cause i
 remember it all all all  they say alls well that ends well but

y everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not weepin in a p
arty bathroom some actress askin me what happened you thats what
